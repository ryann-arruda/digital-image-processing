# Digital Image Processing

All the information presented here was gathered by me through my studies in the Digital Image Processing class teached by Professor Leonardo Vidal Batista, bibliographic research carried out and personal practices.

## **Introduction**

An image is a two-dimensional function **f(x,y)**, where **x** and **y** are spatial coordinates and **f** is a gray level of the image at that point. However, if **x**, **y** and **f** are finite and discrete values, then the image is called a digital image.

Furthermore, an image is composed of a finite number of elements called **picture elements** (pixel).

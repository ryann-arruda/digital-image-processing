# Digital Image Processing

All the information presented here was gathered by me through my studies in the Digital Image Processing class teached by Professor Leonardo Vidal Batista, bibliographic research carried out and personal practices.

## **Introduction**

A grayscale image is a two-dimensional function **f(x,y)**, where **x** and **y** are spatial coordinates and **f** is a gray level of the image at that point. However, if **x**, **y** and **f** are finite and discrete values, then the image is called a digital image. Thus, a digital image is composed of a finite number of elements called **picture elements** (pixel).

The pixel is based on the RGB color model, where a color is formed by combining the components R (red),G (green) and B (blue). Thus, a pixel is a vector that has both components.

Therefore, image processing consists of techniques where their input and output are images, enabling the application of noise reduction, contrast enhancement, image subtraction and other processing for human and computational interpretation, for easthetic purposes, storage and transmission.
